## Professional Life

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [AbsInt Angewandte Informatik GmbH](https://www.absint.com/).

My work is focused on [static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) on both binary and source level.

For binary programs, the worst-case [stack usage](https://www.absint.com/stackanalyzer/) or [execution time](https://www.absint.com/ait/) are computed.

For source programs, [coding rules](https://www.absint.com/rulechecker/) or [run time errors](https://www.absint.com/astree/) are checked.

## Open Source Projects

In my spare time, I work on various open source projects.

For more details take a look at the [Projects](/projects/) page.
